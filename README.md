# Fir Tree

First project for EPITECH / Coding Academy.

This project is an ASCII art fir tree, rescalable, in C language.

## How to use it

First, open your **Terminal**, and go in the repository where "_tree.c_" is.  
Then, **run** the following command ( You need to have [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) installed in order to run this command ) : 
```
gcc tree.c -o test
```
Now, your **executable file** is created. You just have to run it with the following command, to print your fir tree :
```
./test 5
```
You can change your fir tree size just by using an other number instead of 5
